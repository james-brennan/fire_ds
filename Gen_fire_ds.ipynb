    "First a normal vegetation scene is created with a spectrum chosen from a dataset. Dynamics in space and time are introduced with 3 dimensional perlin noise. This makes the data a little more realistic. \n",

    "The spectral representation of fire is with a simple linear mixture model as a function of time after the burn event. A signmoidal function is used to mix between a burn scar of ash/char and a return to the vegetation spectrum. "
